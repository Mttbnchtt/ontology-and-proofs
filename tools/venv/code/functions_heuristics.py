## HEURISTIC SEARCHES
#############################################
# find the goal of the proof

# extract concepts from the goal of the proof

# extract encyclopedic knowledge (= conceptual space) related to the the goal

# organize conceptual space along heuristic dimensions (concepts, results, examples)

# apply strategic knowledge
# 1. select concepts for working memory
# 2. select heuristic techniques
# 3. apply means-ends analysis: asses difference between the current problem state and the possible future problem state after the heuristic enrichment and evaluate the difference with respect to the goal

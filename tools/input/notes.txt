Things to study or infer:
1. Graph embedding.
2. Graph similarity.
3. Inferential types and flag to each (or some) node to make 
   explicit the inferential role of that node.
4. Euclid gives only one case explicitly but he refers to the other 
   cases to complete the proof. The ontology should say that the full
   proof-structure is by cases.
5. Should the use of previously available propositions (e.g. I.16 
   and axiom 4) be the use of the general proposition or of an instance
   (that, e.g., mentions the specific triangle under consideration)?
   Depending on what one choses, there are two different proof 
   structures: (i) universal statement and statements that ABC
   satisfies the universal statement and derivation of the consequent
   (my modus ponens); (ii) proof of the particular statement following 
   the template provided by the proof of the general statement.

Article:
1. We state that a segment is side of a triangle but not list this as a step in a proof.

ISSUES:
1. redo dependency graphs to have 2 in Euclid as a leave.

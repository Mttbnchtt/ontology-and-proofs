concepts:
- isosceles triangle
- side of triangle
- angle
- enclosed angle
- equal sides
- equal angles
- same angle

relations:
- equal(finite_straight_line: AB, finite_straight_line: AC)
- equal(angle: BAC, angle: CAB)
- equal(angle: ABC, angle: ACB)
- isosceles(triangle: ABC)
- same(angle: BAC, angle: CAB)
- enclose(angle: BAC, finite_straight_line: AB, finite_straight_line: AC)

procedures:
1. consider_as_two(triangle: ABC) --> triangle: ABC1, triangle: ABC2
2. compare_triangles(triangle: ABC1, triangle: ABC2)
3. verify_equal_parts(finite_straight_line: AB, finite_straight_line: AC, angle: BAC)

implications:
- isosceles(triangle: ABC) |- equal(finite_straight_line: AB, finite_straight_line: AC)
- equal(finite_straight_line: AB, finite_straight_line: AC) & same(angle: BAC) |- 
    equal(triangle: ABC1, triangle: ABC2)
- equal(triangle: ABC1, triangle: ABC2) |- equal(angle: ABC, angle: ACB)

moral:
A figure can be thought of as containing two instances of itself when it has symmetry; identity implies equality

gist:
An isosceles triangle can be viewed as two identical triangles sharing the same sides and angles

key insights:
- Instead of Euclid's construction with extended lines, Pappus uses a mental operation of viewing the same triangle twice
- The proof leverages the fact that an angle is equal to itself (identity principle)
- The symmetry of the isosceles triangle is revealed by this mental superposition
- No need for auxiliary constructions, unlike Euclid's proof

dependencies:
- Proposition 4 (SAS triangle congruence)
- Common Notion 1 (things equal to same are equal)
- Definition of isosceles triangle
- Identity principle (a thing is equal to itself)

proposition type: theorem

The key difference from Euclid's proof is that Pappus uses a clever mental operation (considering the same triangle twice) rather than physical construction. This demonstrates a more abstract, conceptual approach to geometric proof.
